The ADM
The Preliminary Phase
Phase A: Architecture Vision describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle
Phase B: Business Architecture describes the development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
Phase C: Information Systems Architectures describes the development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision
Phase D: Technology Architecture describes the development of the Technology Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases
Phase F: Migration Planning addresses how to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan
Phase G: Implementation Governance provides an architectural oversight of the implementation
Phase H: Architecture Change Management establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture
Requirements Management examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM

The Architecture Content Framework uses the following three categories to describe the type of architectural work product within the context of use:
A deliverable is a work product that is contractually specified and in turn formally reviewed, agreed, and signed off by the stakeholders.
An artifact is an architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture.
A building block represents a (potentially re-usable) component of enterprise capability that can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions.
Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) typically describe required capability and shape the specification of Solution Building Blocks (SBBs);
Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) represent components that will be used to implement the required capability;

The Enterprise Continuum
The Enterprise Continuum is a view of the Architecture Repository that provides methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures.
The Enterprise Continuum comprises two complementary concepts: 
the Architecture Continuum 
the Solutions Continuum
The Architecture Repository
Architecture Repository which can be used to store different classes of architectural output at different levels of abstraction, created by the ADM. In this way, the TOGAF standard facilitates understanding and co-operation between stakeholders and practitioners at different levels.
By means of the Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository, architects are encouraged to leverage all other relevant architectural resources and assets in developing an Organization-Specific Architecture.
The major components within an Architecture Repository are as follows:
The Architecture Metamodel describes the organizationally tailored application of an architecture framework, including a metamodel for architecture content 
The Architecture Capability defines the parameters, structures, and processes that support governance of the Architecture Repository
The Architecture Landscape is the architectural representation of assets deployed within the operating enterprise at a particular point in time â€” the landscape is likely to exist at multiple levels of abstraction to suit different architecture objectives
The Standards Information Base (SIB) captures the standards with which new architectures must comply, which may include industry standards, selected products and services from suppliers, or shared services already deployed within the organization
The Reference Library provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material that can be leveraged in order to accelerate the creation of new architectures for the enterprise
The Governance Log provides a record of governance activity across the enterprise
The Architecture Requirements Repository provides a view of all authorized architecture
requirements which have been agreed with the Architecture Board
The Solutions Landscape presents an architectural representation of the SBBs supporting
the Architecture Landscape which have been planned or deployed by the enterprise
